            <h1>Oath</h1>
            <p class="introduction">
                <span class="blackletter">I swear,</span>
                <em>to fulfill according to the best
<br /> of my <strong>ability</strong> and <strong>judgement</strong>,
<br /> this oath and this covenant</em>
            </p>
            <ul class="oath">

                <li>I will respect the <strong>knowledge</strong> of the people whose steps I walk <span>and those who teach me and help me, and gladly share this knowledge with those who are to follow, as others have shared with me. I will remember that <strong>knowledge must not be kept secret</strong> for those wishing to learn.</span></li>

                <li>I will use technology for <strong>good</strong> <span>and for the <strong>progress</strong> of mankind, free of evil, for the betterment of peoples' lives.</span></li>

                <li>I will not use my knowledge for unfair profit, <span>financial or of other kind. I will not claim that use of technology is necessary when it is not, but only for the solution of <strong>real</strong> problems, free of all intentional injustice.</span></li>

                <li>I will remember that technology always <strong>improves</strong>, <span>and will never stop learning, and the purpose of my life will be continuous <strong>self-improvement</strong>.</span></li>

                <li>I will remember that there is <strong>art</strong> to software engineering as well as technology, <span>and that there is beauty in code. I will not forget that programs must be written for <strong>people</strong> to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.</span></li>

                <li>I will remember that technology foundations lie in <strong>science</strong>, <span>and I will not forget the contribution of the scientists who supported my art; those who developed mathematics, physics, chemistry and the science of computation.</span></li>

                <li>I will not be ashamed to say <q>I know not</q>, <span>nor will I fail to call in another engineer if needed.</span></li>

                <li>When through technology I gain access to private data, I will respect <strong>privacy</strong> <span>and will not abuse the information at hand.</span></li>

                <li>I will remember as an engineer that along with my ability and power comes the <strong>obligation</strong> <span>to <strong>create</strong> and make the life of my fellow humans better.</span></li>

            </ul>
            <p class="epilogue">
                If I do not violate this oath,
<br /> may it be granted to me to enjoy <strong>life</strong> and <strong>art</strong>,
<br /> <strong>respected</strong> while I live
<br /> and remembered with <strong>affection</strong> thereafter.
            </p>
            <p class="epilogue">
                May I act as to preserve the <strong>finest traditions</strong> of my calling
<br /> and may I long experience the joy of <strong>innovation</strong>.
<br /> And may I experience the <strong>joy</strong> of offering to my art
<br /> new elements to make it <strong>progress</strong>.
